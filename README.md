## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
3. Ensure the `images/` folder is in the same directory as the `index.html` file for all images to load correctly.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Images Not Displaying**:  
  - Verify that the `images/` folder exists in the correct directory.
  - Ensure image file names and paths match exactly, as paths are case-sensitive.
- **Responsive Images**: Test the site on different screen sizes to ensure images resize and adapt correctly.
